## **Introduction**

This project involves creating a lexer (scanner) for a custom programming language designed for musical notation and playback commands. The lexer reads source code written in this language and outputs a list of tokens, showing state transitions using finite automata. It also handles lexical errors appropriately, highlighting where issues in the input occur.

---

## **Language Structure**

Our custom language is designed for music composition and playback commands. It allows users to declare instruments, beats per minute (BPM), composers, and titles, and specify music notes with their corresponding durations.

### **Key Constructs**:
1. **Instrument Declaration**: Specifies the instrument used, such as `Piano` or `Violin`.
   
   ```plaintext
   INSTRUMENT = Piano;
   ```

2. **BPM Declaration**: Sets the beats per minute for the music playback.
   
   ```plaintext
   BPM = 120;
   ```

3. **Composer and Title Declaration**: Allows the user to assign a title and a composer name for the piece.
   
   ```plaintext
   TITLE = "Some Title";
   COMPOSER = "Some Composer";
   ```

4. **Play Command**: Defines the notes to be played along with their duration. A note consists of a solfege syllable (e.g., `Do`, `Re`), an octave (0-7), and an optional accidental (`#`, `-`, `_`).

   ```plaintext
   PLAY Do4# quarter;
   ```

5. **Music Notes**: Music notes are expressed in solfege notation (e.g., `Do`, `Re`, `Mi`), followed by an octave number (e.g., `4` for middle octave), and an accidental (`#` for sharp, `-` for natural, `_` for flat).

6. **End Command**: Marks the end of the music declaration.
   
   ```plaintext
   END;
   ```

---

## **Lexical Grammar**

### **Token Types and Definitions**

Our language consists of the following token types:

1. **Keywords**: Reserved words with special meaning, such as commands for setting the instrument, BPM, title, composer, and playing notes.

   - **Tokens**: `INSTRUMENT`, `BPM`, `PLAY`, `TITLE`, `COMPOSER`, `END`
   - **Regex**: `instrument|bpm|play|end|title|composer`

2. **Identifiers**: User-defined variable names like the instrument name.

   - **Regex**: `[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9_]*`

3. **Operators**: Used for assignments, including `=` and `:`.

   - **Regex**: `=``:`

4. **Numbers**: Represent integer values, such as BPM or the octave of a note.

   - **Regex**: `[0-9]+`

5. **String Literals**: Text enclosed in double quotes, such as a composer’s name.

   - **Regex**: `\"[^\n\r\"]*\"`

6. **Music Notes**: Music notes consist of a solfege syllable (e.g., `Do`, `Re`), followed by an octave number, and an accidental (`#`, `-`, `_`).

   - **Regex**: `(do|re|mi|fa|so|la|ti)[0-7](#|-|_)`

7. **Durations**: Indicate how long a note is held, such as `quarter`, `half`, `whole`.

   - **Regex**: `whole|half|quarter|eighth|sixteenth`

8. **Punctuation**: Characters that separate statements or commands.

   - **Tokens**: `(`, `)`, `;`, `,`
   - **Regex**: `\(|\)|;|,`

### **Summary of Tokens**

| MUSICNOTE      | `Do5#`        | Music note notation                       |
| DURATION       | `quarter`     | Note durations                            |
| LPAREN         | `(`           | Left parenthesis                          |
| RPAREN         | `)`           | Right parenthesis                         |
| SEMICOLON      | `;`           | Statement terminator                      |
| COMMA          | `,`           | Separator                                 |

## **Installation and Execution**

### **Prerequisites**

- **OCaml Compiler**: Ensure that the OCaml compiler (`ocamlc`) is installed on your system.
- Instruction for installing Ocaml: https://ocaml.org/docs/installing-ocaml

  - **Installation on Ubuntu/Debian**:
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install ocaml
    ```

  - **Installation on macOS (using Homebrew)**:
    ```bash
    brew install ocaml
    ```

### **Installation Steps**

1. **Clone the Repository**: Download or clone the project files to your local machine.

2. **Make the Script Executable**: Ensure the `install_and_run.sh` script has execute permissions.

   ```bash
   chmod +x install_and_run.sh
   ```

### **Execution**

Run the lexer using the provided shell script:

```bash
./install_and_run.sh <input_file>
```

- Replace `<input_file>` with the path to one of the sample input programs.

**Example**:

```bash
./install_and_run.sh Program1.txt
```

## **Detailed Description of Each Step**

### **Scanner Algorithm**

The scanner reads the input source code character by character and tokenizes it based on the defined lexical grammar. It uses explicit state transitions to model a finite automaton for each token type.

### **State Transitions with Finite Automata**

The lexer models finite automata for complex tokens, such as music notes and string literals. Each token type is processed by transitioning between states. If a character does not match the expected token pattern, the lexer raises a `LexingError`.

## **Conclusion**

This project successfully implements a lexer for a custom programming language focused on musical notation. The lexer reads input files, tokenizes the content based on defined lexical grammar, shows state transitions using finite automata, and handles lexical errors appropriately.

By following the instructions in this README, you can compile and run the lexer on provided sample programs or your own source code written in the language.
